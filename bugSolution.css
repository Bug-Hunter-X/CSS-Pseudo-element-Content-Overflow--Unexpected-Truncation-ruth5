Several approaches can be used to address this issue, depending on the desired outcome:

**1. Using JavaScript:**

The most reliable approach is to dynamically manage the content using JavaScript.  You could truncate or shorten the text before applying it as the pseudo-element's content.  This offers flexibility and consistent behavior across browsers.

**2. Multiple Pseudo-elements (for partial display):**

For partial display, create multiple pseudo-elements, each displaying a segment of the long string.  This requires careful styling to align them.

**3. Line Breaks (for wrapping):**

If wrapping is acceptable, you can manually insert line breaks (`\A`) into the content string to force it to wrap within the container's width.

**4. CSS `text-overflow: ellipsis;` (Limited Applicability):**

While `text-overflow: ellipsis;` is suitable for single-line text, it's not guaranteed to work correctly with multi-line content within pseudo-elements across all browsers.  Consider this only if you're sure the text will be short enough to occupy only one line.

Here's an example of using JavaScript to truncate the content:

```javascript
const container = document.querySelector('.container');
const longString = "This is a very long string that might overflow the container.";

function truncateString(str, maxLength) {
  return str.length > maxLength ? str.substring(0, maxLength - 3) + '...' : str;
}

const truncatedString = truncateString(longString, 50);

container.style.setProperty('--truncated-string', truncatedString);
```

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  --truncated-string: "This is a very long string..."
}

.container::before {
  content: var(--truncated-string);
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```
