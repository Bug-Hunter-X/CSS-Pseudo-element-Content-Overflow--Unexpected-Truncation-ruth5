# CSS Pseudo-element Content Overflow

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to handling long strings within CSS pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`).  The issue involves unexpected truncation or misrendering of the content when it exceeds the dimensions of its parent container.

## Problem Description

The problem occurs when a pseudo-element's `content` property contains a lengthy string that surpasses the boundaries of its parent element.  Standard overflow properties and techniques (like `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, etc.) may not reliably address this issue with pseudo-elements in all browsers.

## Solution

The provided solution explores different approaches to work around this limitation and control the display of long strings within pseudo-elements to prevent unexpected truncation.
