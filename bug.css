The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue where a pseudo-element's content is unexpectedly truncated or not displayed correctly.

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
}

.container::before {
  content: "This is a very long string that might overflow the container.";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

The problem arises because the `::before` pseudo-element's content is not wrapped or handled appropriately when it exceeds the boundaries of its parent container.  Standard text overflow techniques don't directly apply to pseudo-element content.
